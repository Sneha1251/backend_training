# Mongoose Documentation

## Introduction to MongoDB

### What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, allowing developers to store and access data in a more natural way compared to traditional relational databases.

### Key Features of MongoDB

- **Document-Oriented**: Data is stored in flexible, JSON-like documents.
- **Schemaless**: No rigid schema requirements, making it easy to iterate and evolve data models.
- **High Performance**: Supports high throughput and low latency for read and write operations.
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Easily scales out across multiple servers to handle growing data volumes.
- **Rich Query Language**: Supports a wide range of queries, including ad-hoc queries, indexing, and aggregation.

## Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)

### What is ORM?

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique that converts data between incompatible systems (e.g., object-oriented programming languages and relational databases). It maps object-oriented entities to relational database tables and vice versa, providing a bridge between the two paradigms.

### Advantages of ORM

- **Simplified Data Access**: Developers can interact with databases using familiar object-oriented syntax, reducing the need to write complex SQL queries.
- **Portability**: ORM frameworks abstract database-specific details, making it easier to switch between different database systems.
- **Improved Productivity**: ORM tools automate common database operations, reducing development time and effort.

## Introduction to Mongoose

### What is Mongoose?

Mongoose is an Object-Document Mapping (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a schema-based solution for modeling application data, enforcing data integrity, and simplifying database interactions. Mongoose bridges the gap between MongoDB's document-oriented nature and Node.js's object-oriented programming model.

### Key Features of Mongoose

- **Schema Definition**: Allows developers to define a schema for data models, including data types, validation rules, and default values.
- **Middleware Support**: Supports pre and post middleware functions for schema methods, queries, and document validation.
- **Query Building**: Provides a fluent API for building MongoDB queries using method chaining.
- **Data Validation**: Automatically validates documents against the defined schema before saving them to the database.
- **Population**: Supports population of referenced documents from other collections, enabling data aggregation and denormalization.

## Distinctions Between RDBMS and NoSQL Databases

### Relational Databases (RDBMS) (Continued)

- **Schema Enforcement**: RDBMS enforces a rigid schema with predefined tables, columns, and relationships.
- **ACID Transactions**: Supports Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID) properties to ensure data integrity.
- **SQL Query Language**: Relational databases use Structured Query Language (SQL) for data manipulation and retrieval.
- **Vertical Scalability**: Scales by increasing the power of individual servers (vertical scaling).

### NoSQL Databases

- **Flexible Data Model**: NoSQL databases support various data models, including document-based, key-value, column-oriented, and graph databases.
- **Schemaless or Schema-Light**: NoSQL databases offer flexibility in data schema, allowing developers to store unstructured or semi-structured data.
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Scales by distributing data across multiple servers (horizontal scaling), enabling seamless expansion to handle large volumes of data.
- **High Performance**: NoSQL databases prioritize performance and scalability, often sacrificing strict consistency for improved throughput and latency.
- **Non-SQL Query Languages**: NoSQL databases use different query languages or APIs tailored to specific data models, such as MongoDB's query language or Amazon DynamoDB's API.
